Basic Installation
==================

Windows
=======

    Installation under Windows is pretty strightforward.
    Download executable installation from SourceForge and run it.
    It installs OpenCV, registers DirectShow filters and performs
    other post-installation procedures.
    After that you can start using OpenCV.

    Building OpenCV from sources
    ----------------------------

    Also, it is possible to build the modified OpenCV from source, or
    build the latest OpenCV snapshot,
    obtained from SourceForge CVS (see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=22870).

    +++ These are instructions for MSVC 6.0, MSVC.NET 2003 and MSVC.NET 2005

    * Specify the appropriate CVSROOT (see the link above) in WinCVS and
      checkout the module "opencv".
    * Open opencv\_make\opencv.dsw (in case of MSVC 6.0 or MSVC.NET 2003, in the latter
      case they will be converted to MSVC.NET 2003 project files),
      or opencv\_make\opencv.sln (in case of MSVC.NET 2005)
    * Select the configuration of interest, for example, Win32 Release, and build it.
    * Add opencv\bin to the system PATH.
      The path can be modified at
      MyComputer--[right button click]-->Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables.

    +++ One may also build OpenCV with command-line tools from Microsoft Platform SDK
        (Intel compiler can optionally be used instead of the one from Microsoft),
        or with MinGW - native GNU C/C++ port to Win32.
        The platforms supported are: Win32 on IA32, Win64 on EM64T/AMD64, Win64 on Itanium.

    * Install platform SDK or MinGW (with GCC 3.x or 4.x),
      Intel Compiler 9.0 or later (if needed)
    * Edit opencv\_make\make_cfg.mak, correct the paths to the SDK and ICC.
    * In the command-line prompt:
      * Enter opencv\_make directory
      * Run of the following:
        nmake /f makefile.32 - build IA32 version with cl compiler
        nmake /f makefile.icc - build IA32 version with icc (icl) compiler
        nmake /f makefile.vs - build IA32 version with cl compiler,
                               environment variables are used instead of the Platform SDK.
                               (ideal as command-line alternative to MSVC 6.0)
        nmake /f makefile.64 - build EM64T/AMD64 version using Platform SDK
                               (the produced DLLs will have _64 suffix)
        nmake /f makefile.i7 - build Itanium version using Platform SDK
                               (the produced DLLs will have _i7 suffix).

        mingw32-make -f make_all_gnu.mak - build IA32 version with gcc compiler
                (Make sure that <gcc_root>\bin is in the system path.
                 To build VFW-enabled highgui, read instructions in
                 opencv\otherlibs\_graphics\readme.txt)

   How to test built OpenCV binaries
   ---------------------------------

   Build and run samples at opencv\samples\c.
   (Note: some of the demos need an AVI file or a camera, e.g. motempl.c)
   
   or run algorithmic tests: opencv\bin\cxcoretest.exe, opencv\bin\cvtest.exe.
   It will produce cxcoretest.sum and cvtest.sum, respectively, that should hopefully
   contain all OK's.

   How to add IPP support
   ----------------------

   + Obtain IPP from Intel site (http://www.intel.com/software/products/ipp/index.htm),
     version 5.1 or later is preferrable, and install it.
   + Make sure the appropriate binary folder
     (e.g. c:\program files\intel\ipp\5.1\ia32\bin) is in the system path.
   + That's it. IPP should be automatically detected by OpenCV and loaded at runtime.
   + To smaller memory footprint and shorter application loading time,
     it is possible to build custom IPP dll for OpenCV, ippopencv*.dll, see interfaces\ipp.
   + It is possible to load/unload IPP at runtime, see cvUseOptimized() function.


Linux
=====

   There are no prebuilt binaries for Linux versions (because of a large variety of
   different versions of GCC and GLIBC in different distributions) from our side. So, if
   your distributor (SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu) doesn't offer OpenCV, you'll have
   to build it from sources.

   That's what you need to build fully-functionaly libraries and demos:
   ======

   + GTK+ 2.x or higher including headers

   + pkgconfig

   + libpng, zlib, libjpeg, libtiff, libjasper with development files.

   + Python 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 with headers installed (developer package)

   + libavcodec, etc. from ffmpeg 0.4.9-pre1 or later + headers.
     Earlier versions do not work with OpenCV because of different API.
     libavcodec is LGPL software, so to use it with non-GPL software (such as OpenCV)
     you need to build and use a _shared_ library libavcodec.so.*:
        get ffmpeg from ffmpeg.sourceforge.net
        ./configure --enable-shared
        make
        make install
        you will have got: /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so.*
                           /usr/local/lib/libavformat.so.*
                          (/usr/local/lib/libavutil.so.* for newer versions)
                           /usr/local/include/ffmpeg/*.h

   Now build OpenCV:  
   ======
   
   a) if your distribution uses RPM, you may build RPMs using:
         rpmbuild -ta OpenCV-x.y.z.tar.gz (for RPM 4.x or later) or
         rpm -ta OpenCV-x.y.z.tar.gz" (for eariler versions of RPM)
      where OpenCV-x.y.z.tar.gz should be put to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/ or
      similar directory  

      it will build OpenCV-x.y.z.*.rpm
      (there is no OpenCV-devel, everything is in one package)
      
      then install it by:
        rpm -i OpenCV-x.y.z.*.rpm
      
   b) if your distribution does not support RPM, build and install it
      in Unix/Linux traditional way:

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig

      You can influence which libraries are used and which features are
      enabled by specifying the appropriate flags to ./configure. 

      See './configure --help' for more information.


   both a&b (post-install))
      
      default installation path is /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/opencv,
      so you need to add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf (and run ldconfig after)
      or add it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

   c) if you want to step in as an OpenCV developer, you will need some additional tools:

      autoconf-2.59 (including autoheader-2.59)
      automake-1.9* (including aclocal-1.9*)
      libtool-1.5 (including libtoolize-1.5)
      swig (version 1.3.30 or current CVS version respectively)

      If the default versions of these tools installed on your machine differs, you
      should specify the paths to the required versions via environment variables. For
      example, if 'automake --version' gives you a version number 1.7.x but there is
      /usr/bin/automake-1.9 installed on your machine, then call 

      export AUTOMAKE=/usr/binautomake-1.9

      whenever you want to work on OpenCV sources.

      In addition, you should 'configure --enable-maintainer-mode', so that all
      autotools are invoked automagically, if Makefile's or the configure-script
      need to be regenerated. You can manually regenerate everything by starting
      'autoreconf' from the top directory.


   How to test OpenCV:
   =======

   + You can compile test programs using the traditional check target
     of automake projects:

        make check

     This implicitly runs the folowing test programs:

        tests/cv/src/cvtest
        tests/cxcore/src/cxcoretest
   
   + or
     compile and run simple c examples at
     /usr/local/share/opencv/samples, e.g.:

     g++ `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o morphology morphology.c `pkg-config --libs opencv`
     Plain gcc won't work because of unresolved c++-specific symbols (located in highgui?)
   
   
   How to make OpenCV use IPP:
   =======

   + install IPP.
     Let's assume, it installs to /opt/intel/ipp/5.1/ia32.
   
   + add <install_path>/bin and <install_path>/bin/linux32
     (for example, /opt/intel/ipp/5.1/ia32/bin and /opt/intel/ipp/5.1/ia32/bin/linux32)
     to LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your initialization script (.bashrc or similar):

     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/ipp/5.1/ia32/bin:/opt/intel/ipp/5.1/ia32/bin/linux32:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

     or add these two directories, one per line, to /etc/ld.so.conf and run
     ldconfig as root.

   + that's it. Now OpenCV should be able to locate IPP shared libraries and make use of them.


MacOSX
======

   (TODO: add more detailed description)
   (see also OpenCV Wiki)

   + Basically, the requirements and building instructions are very similar to Linux case,
     with the following exceptions:

     * Carbon is used instead of GTK+ by default
     * Quicktime is used instead of FFMPEG by default
     * pkg-config is optional (it is only used explicitly in samples\c\build_all.sh script)
     * RPM and ldconfig are not supported by default,
       use configure+make+sudo make install to build and install OpenCV,
       update LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unless ./configure --prefix=/usr is used).

     * for full functionality, you should install libpng, libtiff, libjpeg and libjasper
       from darwinports and/or fink and make them available to ./configure (see ./configure --help)

   + Known problems:

     * Currently there is no way to write AVI files with QuickTime
     * A plain OS X system doesn't have libpng, libtiff, libjasper installed, so
       you won't be able to read or write these image formats
     * The build system doesn't allow to build functional universal libraries at this time
     * The build system doesn't allow to build with the intel compiler on OS X at this time

   + If you'd like to step in as a developer, you will need to get the appropriate
     versions of automake, etc. (see Linux section) from darwinports.
